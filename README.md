# Orange Dashboard

The Orange Dashboard is a web-based platform that enables users to monitor network traffic and security incidents. The dashboard is built using Node.js and React.js, and it retrieves data from two network security monitoring tools, Zeek and Suricata. The data is stored in a database, which is then queried and displayed on the dashboard in a user-friendly format.
<br>
## Features <br>
The Orange Dashboard provides a range of features that make it a useful tool for monitoring network security, 
<br>
including:<br>
Real-time monitoring of network traffic and security incidents<br>
Customizable dashboard layout<br>
Detailed information about network events, including timestamp, source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers<br>
Integrated charts and graphs for visualizing network activity<br>
Export functionality for exporting data to a CSV file<br>
User authentication and authorization to control access to the dashboard<br>
Technologies Used<br>
The Orange Dashboard is built using a range of modern web development technologies, including:<br>

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.<br>
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.<br>
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.<br>
Chart.js: A JavaScript charting library for creating interactive charts and graphs<br>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
